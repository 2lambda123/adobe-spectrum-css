# Deprecating a component

When a component is deprecated, it is no longer recommended for use. Though the component will be removed from the codebase and will no longer receive feature updates, we will apply bug fixes to the package as necessary. We will also provide a migration path to a recommended alternative.

## Deprecation process

1. **Deprecate the component**: Add a deprecation notice to the component's documentation. This notice should include the version in which the component was deprecated and the version in which it will be removed. The notice should also include a link to the recommended alternative.



1. Create a new folder with the component name in `.storybook/deprecated`, i.e., `.storybook/deprecated/quickaction`.
2. Copy _.stories.js and metadata/_.yml into the new folder (directly, not nested inside subfolders).
3. Update the title of the `*.stories.js` asset to be prefixed with the `Deprecated` category, i.e., `title: "Deprecated/Quick actions"`.
4. Update any local references to `template.js` or other files to point to their package name, i.e., `import { Template } from "./template";` -> `import { Template } from "@spectrum-css/quickaction/stories/template.js";`.
5. In the parameters section of the `*.stories.js`, add `chromatic: { disable: true },` to ensure it no longer runs regression tests.
6. Update the status of the component to `Deprecated` in the `*.yml` file. Add any additional migration notes to the `deprecationNotice` keyword.
7. Delete the package from the components directory.
