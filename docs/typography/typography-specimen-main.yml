        <p>Creative Cloud for desktop is a great place to start any creative project. Quickly launch and update your desktop apps; manage and share your assets stored in Creative Cloud; download fonts from Adobe Typekit or high-quality royalty-free assets right within the app; and showcase and discover creative work on Behance. Best of all, the application stays out of your way but is there when you need it, so you can focus on <em>creativity</em>.</p>
