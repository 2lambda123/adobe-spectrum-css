  Down state is a Spectrum 2 (S2) feature that creates the illusion of components being pressed-in when active. There are two different ways to implement down state depending on the component.

  If the component is interactable at it's root level:
    - Add the `.spectrum-DownState` class to the root of the element that receives interactions.
      - Components with a width of 24px or less require the addition of the `.spectrum-DownState--min-perpsective` class next to the `.spectrum-DownState` class.
    - Develop an implementation to determine the width and height of the component. Assign this to the `--spectrum-downstate-width` and `--spectrum-downstate-height` custom properties in a `style` attribute on the HTML element.

  If the component has an interactable element nested within it, this will require CSS changes:
    - Use the `%spectrum-DownState` or `%spectrum-DownState--min-perspective` placeholder on the interactable element when the root of the component is in an `:active` state.
      - Components with a width of 24px or less require the `%spectrum-DownState--min-perspective` placeholder instead.
    - Note that this functionality is included in S2 components that require down state in this project. This can be seen in the [checkbox component](/checkbox.html).
examples:
  - id: downstate
    name: Down state - utility class
