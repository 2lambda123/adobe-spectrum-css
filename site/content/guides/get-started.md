# Get started with Spectrum CSS {.spectrum-Heading .spectrum-Heading--sizeXXL .spectrum-Heading--serif #get-started}

We have a number of resources that outline how to set up Spectrum CSS for your project, as well as an introductory tutorial that provides a hands-on way to understand how our implementation works. {.spectrum-Body .spectrum-Body--sizeXXL}

## Install

Spectrum CSS requires a Node.js environment with a minimum version of 14. Each component is released on npm as a distinct package inside of the [@spectrum-css org](https://www.npmjs.com/org/spectrum-css).

First, install the required button dependencies by running:

```sh
yarn add -D @spectrum-css/tokens @spectrum-css/button @spectrum-css/page
```

We definitely need the `@spectrum-css/button` package in order to add a button to our project. We're going to use the `@spectrum-css/page` component to wrap our button in some default styles. The `@spectrum-css/tokens` package provide global Spectrum CSS styling for responsiveness and themes that we will need for our components to display properly.

Installed components will be available in the node_modules/@spectrum-css/ folder.

## Applying styles

### Setting context

Spectrum CSS components utilize custom properties in order to change themes and scales. For these to apply, a couple of classes need to be added to the document's `html` tag based on the scale and theme you wish to use. For example, the following code snippet will display styling for the medium scale and light color theme:

```html
<html class="spectrum spectrum--medium spectrum--light"></html>
```

### Stylesheets

Inside the `<head>` tag, include the stylesheets that contain the design system tokens, as well as the stylesheets for the components themselves:

```html
<head>
    <!-- Include global tokens first -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@spectrum-css/tokens/dist/index.css" />

    <!-- Include index-vars.css for all components you're using -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@spectrum-css/page/dist/index-vars.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@spectrum-css/button/dist/index-vars.css" />
</head>
```

## Semantic markup

Inside your application, add the recommended markup for a Spectrum button. The example also includes the CSS class names, `spectrum-Button--fill spectrum-Button--accent`, to use a call-to-action variant.

```html
<button class="spectrum-Button spectrum-Button--fill spectrum-Button--accent spectrum-Button--sizeM">
    <span class="spectrum-Button-label">Button</span>
</button>
```

Here's what it all looks like together:

```html
<html class="spectrum spectrum--light spectrum--medium">
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@spectrum-css/tokens/dist/index.css" />
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@spectrum-css/page/dist/index-vars.css" />
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@spectrum-css/button/dist/index-vars.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <button class="spectrum-Button spectrum-Button--fill spectrum-Button--accent spectrum-Button--sizeM">
            <span class="spectrum-Button-label">Button</span>
        </button>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Modifying Spectrum CSS components

You can modify the look and feel of Spectrum CSS by overriding the custom variables for a component. Look for the Custom Property API section in the component docs for a list of variables that you can set to override styles. See the [Button docs](button-accent.html#custompropertiesapi) as an example.

You can override the available mod variables listed by adding something like the following to your CSS:

```css
--mod-button-border-radius: 10px;
```
