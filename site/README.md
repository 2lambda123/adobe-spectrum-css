# Spectrum CSS Site

The site is built using [Pug templates](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html).

## Architecture

The site build process generates separate `.html` files for each of the `*.pug` files in the `site/` folder, as well as `.html` pages for each of the component examples within each package (`metadata.yml` and `metadata/*.yml`). The navigation on the left is generated from the list of examples + the hardcoded pages in the menu, and is injected at build time. All of the generated `.html` files are standalone documents with the same navigation and common dependencies, with component example pages adding only the additional dependencies that are required to render its examples.

When clicking an item in the nav or using the browser history, instead of simply navigating to the new page, the page is requested with `XMLHTTPRequest`, parsed, and the content is extracted and injected. Additionally, the dependencies included on the page (any `link` tag with the `data-dependency="$NAME"`) are diffed with the existing dependencies on the page, and the new dependencies are asynchronously loaded before the page content so as to prevent FOUC (flash of unstyled content). Finally, the corresponding item in the side nav is selected.

Because the dependencies included in the component example pages are sorted in topological order with [`dependency-solver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dependency-solver), it is not possible for dependencies to be loaded out of order, even if navigating between pages in a different order -- only the new dependencies will be added to the end of the list of dependencies, so precedence will be preserved.

## Viewing the site

1. Run `gulp dev` at the top level of the project and the site will build and open up in your browser.

## Editing content

1. Run `gulp dev` at the top level of the project.
2. Edit the `*.pug` files in this folder as well as `includes/*.pug` and the site will live reload with your changes.

## Adding a new page

1. Run `gulp dev` at the top level of the project.
2. Create the Pug template file for the page in this folder by copying an existing page:

```shell
cp getting-started.pug new-page.pug
```

3. Manually add the new page to the navigation in `includes/nav.pug`, including the `.js-fastLoad` class on the link and the `is-selected` switch on the list item:

```pug
      li.spectrum-SideNav-item(class=pageURL === 'new-page.html' ? 'is-selected' : '')
        a.spectrum-SideNav-itemLink.js-fastLoad(href='new-page.html') New Page
```

4. Your new page will appear in the navigation. You can continue to edit it and it will live reload.
5. If you page uses other Spectrum CSS components, link to them as necessary beneath the `dependencies.pug` include:

```pug
    include includes/dependencies.pug
    link(rel='stylesheet', type='text/css', href='../components/table/index-vars.css')
```

## Adding a one-off example page

Follow the instructions for adding a new page, but do not add it to the navigation. You can link to it from another document using markdown:

```markdown
See the [internationalized typography example page](typography-i18n.html) for Japanese, Han, and Arabic examples.
```

## Adding and editing resources

You can add and edit site resources to the `resources/` folder. These are copied directly into the root of the site and can be included as necessary. Editing existing resources while `gulp dev` is running will inject the new resources.

## Data structure

The top level of the `.yml` files can have the following properties:

- `id` - If the name of the component doesn't match DNA, provide the DNA ID here.
- `name` - The name of the component (appears in the navigation and as the heading of the page). If not provided, it will be loaded from DNA based on the id.
- `description` - The topmost description of the component. This will be loaded from DNA if something matches the ID of the component.
- `status` - The status of the overall component's design review; one of `Unverified`, `Verified`, or `Deprecated`. This will be pulled from DNA if not provided.
- `examples` - An array of examples which should show each variant of the component (see properties below).
- `examplesHeading` - The heading to use for examples. Default is "Variants"
- `sections` - An optional array of sections to provide additional information (see properties below).

Each item in the `examples` array supports the following properties:

- `id` - Provide the DNA ID here to fetch the status of this example.
- `name` - The name of the example. If not provided, it will be loaded from DNA.
- `description` - The example's description, written in markdown. All links, headings, code blocks, and tables will automatically get Spectrum CSS classes applied to them.
- `markup` - The markup example
- `status` - The status of the example's design review; one of `Unverified`, `Verified`, or `Deprecated`.

Each item in the `sections` array supports the following properties:

- `name` - The name of the example (appears in the navigation and as the heading of the page). If not provided, it will be loaded from DNA.
- `description` - The content of the section, written in markdown. All links, headings, code blocks, and tables will automatically get Spectrum CSS classes applied to them.
- `markup` - An optional markup example for the section

## Script architecture

Documentation is built by parsing `.yml` files within component packages that contain examples and their metadata and combining that with ID-matching of DNA data in `components/vars/spectrum-metadata.json`.

The dependencies for the component's documentation page are determined by parsing the `package.json` and building a dependency graph which is then topologically sorted using [`dependency-solver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dependency-solver). This means that all dependencies and dependencies of dependencies will be included in the documentation pages for the component automatically.

Within each component package, the `metadata.yml` file contains all of the examples that should appear on the main page for a given component. These examples will be printed one after another on the page for that component.

Additional examples that should appear in the navigation independent of the main component page can be added as `metadata/*.yml`. These are treated as a separate documentation page completely, but they share the same dependencies as the main page.
